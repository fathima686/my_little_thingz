## 🛠️ Customization (Optional)

### Want Different Price Thresholds?

Edit: `backend/services/DecisionTreeAddonSuggester.php`

Find this section (around line 28):
```php
private const RULES = [
    [
        'name' => 'Premium Gift Bundle',
        'conditions' => [
            'gift_price' => ['operator' => '>=', 'value' => 1000]  // ← Change 1000
        ],
        'suggestions' => ['greeting_card', 'ribbon']
    ],
```

Change the `'value'` to your desired price.

### Want to Add a New Add-on?

Edit: `backend/services/DecisionTreeAddonSuggester.php`

Find `ADDONS` section (around line 10):
```php
private const ADDONS = [
    'gift_wrapping' => [              // ← Add this
        'id' => 'gift_wrapping',
        'name' => 'Premium Gift Wrapping',
        'description' => '...',
        'price' => 200,
        'icon' => '🎁'
    ],
    // ... rest of add-ons
];
```

Then add it to a rule's suggestions:
```php
'suggestions' => ['greeting_card', 'ribbon', 'gift_wrapping']
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Panel Doesn't Appear
```
✓ Check: Do you have items in cart? (Panel only shows if items exist)
✓ Check: Is your cart total calculated correctly?
✓ Check: Browser DevTools → Console for errors
✓ Solution: Reload page (Ctrl+F5 on Windows)
```

### API Error in Console
```
✓ Check: File exists? 
   /backend/api/customer/addon-suggestion.php
✓ Check: User ID is being sent correctly
✓ Check: Network tab in DevTools for actual response
```

### Styling Looks Wrong
```
✓ Check: CSS file loaded? (check Network tab)
✓ Check: No conflicting CSS framework styles
✓ Solution: Clear cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
```

### Wrong Suggestions Showing
```
✓ Check: Cart total calculation
✓ Check: Rules in DecisionTreeAddonSuggester.php
✓ Check: Condition values match your test cart total
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Test with Different Quantities**
   - Add 1 expensive item (₹2000)
   - Add 5 cheap items (₹100 each = ₹500)
   - See how suggestions differ

2. **Check Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Press F12 → Toggle Device Toolbar
   - Test on iPhone, Android, Tablet sizes
   - All should work smoothly

3. **Monitor Network Requests**
   - Open DevTools → Network tab
   - Add to cart → notice no request
   - Go to checkout → see `addon-suggestion.php` request
   - Check response to see JSON data

4. **Clear Browser Cache if Issues**
   - Windows: Ctrl+Shift+Delete
   - Mac: Cmd+Shift+Delete
   - Or use Incognito/Private mode

## 📱 Responsive Breakpoints

The component adapts to screen sizes:
- **Desktop**: Full width, side-by-side layout
- **Tablet**: Stacked, slightly smaller text
- **Mobile**: Compact, optimized for touch

Test by resizing browser window!

## 🎨 Customizing Look & Feel

### Change Color Theme
File: `frontend/src/styles/addon-suggestions.css`

Find and replace:
```css
#a855f7  /* Purple - change to your color */
```

### Change Text/Messages
File: `backend/services/DecisionTreeAddonSuggester.php`

Find `getReasoningMessage()` function around line 175
