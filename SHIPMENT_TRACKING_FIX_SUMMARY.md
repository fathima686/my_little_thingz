# Order Tracking Fix - Complete Summary

## Problem Identified
Order tracking after payment was completely broken due to multiple issues:

1. **Missing Database Columns**: The `orders` table was missing tracking-related columns
2. **No Pickup Location**: Shiprocket account had no pickup location configured
3. **Address Parsing Bug**: Phone numbers were being extracted as pincodes

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Fixed ✅
**File**: `backend/fix_tracking_database.php`

Added three essential columns to the `orders` table:
- `shipment_status` VARCHAR(100) - Current shipment status from Shiprocket
- `current_status` VARCHAR(100) - Human-readable status
- `tracking_updated_at` TIMESTAMP - Last tracking update time

**Status**: ✅ Completed - All columns added successfully

### 2. Pickup Location Added ✅
**File**: `backend/add_pickup_location.php`

Created pickup location "Purathel" in Shiprocket account:
- Pickup Code: Purathel
- Address: House No. 123, Purathel House, Kottayam Road
- City: Kottayam, Kerala - 686508
- Phone: 9495470077
- Email: fathimashibu15@gmail.com

**Status**: ✅ Completed - Pickup location ID: 11685693

### 3. Address Parsing Fixed ✅
**File**: `backend/services/ShiprocketAutomation.php` (lines 386-478)

**Original Bug**: 
The regex `/\b(\d{6})\b/` was matching the first 6 digits of 10-digit phone numbers.
Example: Phone "9495470077" → Extracted pincode "949547" (WRONG!)

**Fix Implemented**:
Multi-pass intelligent parsing:
1. **Phone Extraction**: First pass identifies phone numbers (10 digits)
2. **Pincode Extraction**: Second pass skips phone lines, then extracts 6-digit pincodes
3. **State Extraction**: Matches against all 29 Indian states
4. **City Extraction**: Extracts from "City, State, Pincode" format
5. **Address Cleaning**: Removes metadata lines (phone, location, country)

**Test Results**:
```
Address: binil jacob, 42/3154A Prathibha Road, Padivattom, Ernakulam, Kerala, 682025, Phone: 9495470077
✅ Phone: 9495470077 (correct)
✅ Pincode: 682025 (correct - not phone number!)
✅ City: Ernakulam (correct)
✅ State: Kerala (correct)
✅ Valid: YES
```

**Status**: ✅ Completed - Address parsing working correctly

### 4. Missing Shiprocket Methods Added ✅
**File**: `backend/models/Shiprocket.php`

Added missing methods:
- `assignCourier($shipmentId, $courierId)` - Assign courier and generate AWB
- `schedulePickup($shipmentId)` - Schedule pickup for shipment

**Status**: ✅ Completed

### 5. Existing Orders Processed ✅
**File**: `backend/test_shiprocket_automation.php`

Processed 5 paid orders that had no shipments:

| Order Number | Shiprocket Order ID | Shiprocket Shipment ID | Status |
|--------------|---------------------|------------------------|--------|
| ORD-20251006-132257-145f7d | 991030333 | 987434391 | ✅ Shipment Created |
| ORD-20251006-130915-760c8b | 991031157 | 987435211 | ✅ Shipment Created |
| ORD-20250923-165018-0265ec | 991031188 | 987435246 | ✅ Shipment Created |
| ORD-20250921-151803-e85fbc | 991031223 | 987435281 | ✅ Shipment Created |
| ORD-20250918-101700-a9109b | 991031240 | 987435298 | ✅ Shipment Created |
| ORD-20250917-082534-7c7848 | 991031262 | 987435320 | ✅ Shipment Created |

**Status**: ✅ Completed - All shipments created in Shiprocket

## Current Status

### ✅ Working
1. Payment verification triggers automation
2. Address parsing extracts correct data
3. Shipments are created in Shiprocket
4. Database is updated with Shiprocket IDs

### ⚠️ Pending Manual Action
**Courier Assignment**: AWB codes are not yet assigned because couriers need to be selected. This can be done:

**Option A - Manual (Recommended for now)**:
1. Log in to Shiprocket dashboard: https://app.shiprocket.in/
2. Go to "Orders" → "Ready to Ship"
3. Select the orders
4. Click "Assign Courier" and choose a courier service
5. AWB codes will be generated automatically

**Option B - Automatic (Requires Configuration)**:
The automation can auto-assign couriers, but it's currently failing. This might require:
- Verifying courier serviceability for the delivery pincodes
- Checking if the Shiprocket account has active courier integrations
- Ensuring sufficient wallet balance for courier charges

## Files Created/Modified

### Created Files:
1. `backend/fix_tracking_database.php` - Database migration script
2. `backend/check_orders.php` - Order inspection utility
3. `backend/check_automation_logs.php` - Log viewer
4. `backend/debug_shiprocket.php` - Shiprocket debugging tool
5. `backend/test_shiprocket_automation.php` - Manual automation trigger
6. `backend/check_pickup_locations.php` - Pickup location checker
7. `backend/add_pickup_location.php` - Pickup location creator
8. `SHIPMENT_TRACKING_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This document

### Modified Files:
1. `backend/services/ShiprocketAutomation.php` - Fixed parseAddress() method (lines 386-478)
2. `backend/models/Shiprocket.php` - Added assignCourier() and schedulePickup() methods

## Testing Workflow

### Test New Order Flow:
1. Place a test order on the website
2. Complete payment using Razorpay
3. Check that shipment is created automatically:
   ```bash
   php backend/check_orders.php
   ```
4. Verify order has `shiprocket_order_id` and `shiprocket_shipment_id`
5. Manually assign courier in Shiprocket dashboard
6. Check that AWB code appears in customer dashboard

### Test Tracking Display:
1. After AWB is assigned, customer should see:
   - AWB tracking number
   - Courier name
   - Shipment status
   - Live tracking timeline (via `api/customer/track-shipment.php`)

## Next Steps

1. **Assign Couriers**: Log in to Shiprocket and assign couriers to the 6 pending shipments
2. **Test End-to-End**: Place a new test order and verify complete flow
3. **Monitor Automation**: Check logs at `backend/logs/shiprocket_automation.log`
4. **Configure Auto-Assignment**: If desired, investigate why automatic courier assignment is failing

## Important Notes

### Address Format for Customers:
Ensure checkout form collects address in this format:
```
[Customer Name]
[Street Address]
[Locality/Area]
[City, State, Pincode]
India
Phone: [10-digit number]
```

### Shiprocket Token Expiry:
- Current token expires: November 16, 2025
- Implement token refresh logic before this date

### Automation Logs:
- Location: `backend/logs/shiprocket_automation.log`
- Monitor for errors and failures

### Database Columns:
The new columns will be populated when:
- `shipment_status`: Updated by tracking API when fetching from Shiprocket
- `current_status`: Updated by tracking API with human-readable status
- `tracking_updated_at`: Updated each time tracking data is refreshed

## Troubleshooting

### If shipments aren't created:
1. Check automation logs: `php backend/check_automation_logs.php`
2. Verify pickup location exists: `php backend/check_pickup_locations.php`
3. Test address parsing: `php backend/debug_shiprocket.php`

### If tracking doesn't show:
1. Verify AWB code is assigned in Shiprocket dashboard
2. Check that `awb_code` column is populated in database
3. Test tracking API: `api/customer/track-shipment.php?awb=<AWB_CODE>`

### If automation fails:
1. Check Shiprocket token is valid (expires Nov 16, 2025)
2. Verify pickup location "Purathel" exists
3. Check database connection and order status

## Success Metrics

✅ Pickup location configured
✅ Address parsing fixed and tested
