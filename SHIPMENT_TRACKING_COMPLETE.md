# üéâ Shipment Tracking System - Complete & Operational

## ‚úÖ System Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL

The order tracking system after payment is now **completely operational**. All critical bugs have been fixed and the system is ready for production use.

---

## üîß Issues Fixed

### 1. **Critical Bug: Address Parsing Collision** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem:** The regex pattern `/\b(\d{6})\b/` was matching the first 6 digits of 10-digit phone numbers as pincodes.
- Example: Phone "9495470077" ‚Üí Extracted "949547" as pincode (WRONG!)
- This caused Shiprocket API to reject all shipment creation requests

**Solution:** Completely rewrote `parseAddress()` method with intelligent multi-pass parsing:
```php
// Pass 1: Extract phone number FIRST
// Pass 2: Extract pincode while SKIPPING lines with 10-digit numbers
// Pass 3: Extract state from comprehensive list
// Pass 4: Extract city from "City, State, Pincode" format
// Pass 5: Build clean address by filtering metadata
```

**File:** `backend/services/ShiprocketAutomation.php` (lines 386-478)

---

### 2. **Missing Pickup Location** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem:** Shiprocket account had NO pickup locations configured
- Error: "Please add billing/shipping address first"
- Shipments cannot be created without at least one pickup location

**Solution:** Added pickup location via Shiprocket API
- **Location Name:** Purathel
- **Location ID:** 11685693
- **Address:** House No. 123, Purathel House, Kottayam Road, Kottayam, Kerala - 686508
- **Contact:** Amal Raj (9495470077)

**File:** `backend/add_pickup_location.php`

---

### 3. **Missing Shiprocket Methods** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem:** `Shiprocket.php` model was missing methods that automation service was calling
- `assignCourier()` - Not found
- `schedulePickup()` - Not found

**Solution:** Added both methods to Shiprocket model
```php
public function assignCourier($shipmentId, $courierId) { ... }
public function schedulePickup($shipmentId) { ... }
```

**File:** `backend/models/Shiprocket.php` (lines 170-220)

### 7. **Tracking API** ‚úÖ
