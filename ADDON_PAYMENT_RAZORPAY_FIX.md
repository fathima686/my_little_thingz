# Add-on Payment Integration Fix - Razorpay Payment Path

**Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Issue**: Add-ons displayed in checkout but not included in Razorpay payment amount  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

---

## Problem Summary

While the "Enhance Your Gift" add-on suggestion panel was displaying correctly on the checkout page with the Greeting Card (₹150) option visible, the selected add-ons **were NOT being included in the final payment amount** when using Razorpay payment.

The issue was isolated to the **Razorpay payment path** - the COD/direct checkout path already had addon support implemented in Phase 1.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

The `razorpay-create-order.php` backend endpoint was **not handling selected add-ons** at all:
- ❌ Not extracting `selected_addons` from the request body
- ❌ Not calculating addon costs
- ❌ Not adding addon total to the final payment amount
- ❌ Not persisting addon selections to the database

Additionally, the `CartPage.jsx` **startRazorpay function** was **not sending addon data** to the backend.

---

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Frontend Changes (CartPage.jsx)

**File**: `frontend/src/pages/CartPage.jsx`  
**Location**: startRazorpay function (line ~184-195)

**What was added**:
```javascript
// Send selected addons to Razorpay backend
selected_addons: selectedAddons.map(addon => ({
  id: addon.id,
  name: addon.name,
  price: addon.price
}))
```

**Impact**: Now the Razorpay payment flow transmits all selected add-ons with their full details to the backend.

---

### 2. Backend Changes (razorpay-create-order.php)

**File**: `backend/api/customer/razorpay-create-order.php`

#### 2.1 Extract and Calculate Add-on Costs (Lines 167-180)

```php
// Extract and calculate addon costs
$addon_total = 0.0;
$selected_addons = [];
if (!empty($bodyInput['selected_addons']) && is_array($bodyInput['selected_addons'])) {
    foreach ($bodyInput['selected_addons'] as $addon) {
        if (isset($addon['id'], $addon['name'], $addon['price'])) {
            $addon_price = (float)$addon['price'];
            $addon_total += $addon_price;
            $selected_addons[] = $addon;
        }
    }
}

$total = $subtotal + $tax + $shipping + $addon_total;
```

**Effect**: 
- Extracts addon objects from request
- Safely calculates total addon cost
- **Includes addon total in the final payment amount** sent to Razorpay

#### 2.2 Persist Add-ons to Database (Lines 207-219)

```php
// Store selected addons if table exists
$hasAddonsTable = false;
try { 
    $chk = $db->query("SHOW TABLES LIKE 'order_addons'"); 
    $hasAddonsTable = $chk && $chk->rowCount() > 0; 
} catch (Throwable $e) {}

if ($hasAddonsTable && !empty($selected_addons)) {
    $insAddon = $db->prepare("INSERT INTO order_addons (order_id, addon_id, addon_name, addon_price, created_at) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, NOW())");
    foreach ($selected_addons as $addon) {
        $insAddon->execute([$order_id, $addon['id'], $addon['name'], (float)$addon['price']]);
    }
}
```

**Effect**:
- Safely checks if `order_addons` table exists
- Persists each selected add-on as a database record
- Maintains audit trail for order history

#### 2.3 Return Add-on Total in Response (Lines 254)

```php
'addon_total' => $addon_total,
```

**Effect**: Provides confirmation that add-ons were processed and included in payment.

## Data Flow Diagram

```
User selects addon (Greeting Card ₹150)
          ↓
AddonSuggestions component sends addon object
          ↓
CartPage.selectedAddons state = [{id, name, price}]
          ↓
User clicks "Pay Securely" (Razorpay)
          ↓
CartPage.startRazorpay() sends to razorpay-create-order.php
  - items
  - selected_options (per item customizations)
  - selected_addons ← [NEW]
          ↓
Backend extracts addons, calculates addon_total (₹150)
          ↓
Final amount = subtotal + tax + shipping + addon_total
  e.g., ₹1500 + ₹0 + ₹60 + ₹150 = ₹1710
          ↓
Razorpay order created with correct amount (1710 paise = ₹17.10)
          ↓
Addons persisted to order_addons table
          ↓
Customer pays correct amount including add-ons
```

Shipping:             ₹60
Add-on (Greeting):    ₹150 ← NOT INCLUDED
─────────────────────────────
Razorpay Amount:      ₹1560  ❌ Wrong!
```

### After Fix (Working)
```
Cart subtotal:        ₹1500
Shipping:             ₹60
Add-on (Greeting):    ₹150 ← INCLUDED
─────────────────────────────
Razorpay Amount:      ₹1710  ✅ Correct!
```

## Technical Details

### Database Schema (order_addons table)
```sql
CREATE TABLE order_addons (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT NOT NULL,
    addon_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    addon_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    addon_price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    INDEX idx_order_id (order_id)
)
```

### API Request Body (CartPage → razorpay-create-order.php)
```json
{
  "user_id": "12345",
  "shipping_address": "Name, Address Line 1, ...",
  "items": [
    {
      "artwork_id": "567",
      "selected_options": { "size": "large", "color": "red" }
    }
  ],
  "selected_addons": [
    {
      "id": "addon_greeting_card",
      "name": "Greeting Card",
      "price": 150
    }
  ]
}
```

### API Response (razorpay-create-order.php → CartPage)
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "order": {
    "id": 789,
    "order_number": "ORD-20251020-120000-abcdef",
    "razorpay_order_id": "order_xyz789",
    "amount": 1710,
    "currency": "INR",
    "subtotal": 1500,
    "tax": 0,

    "addon_total": 150,
    "weight": 2
  },
  "key_id": "rzp_live_xxxx"
}
```

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal overhead**: Added 2 loops (one for calculating addon costs, one for persistence)
- **Database efficiency**: Uses prepared statements and single table insert per addon
- **Payment processing**: No change to Razorpay API latency

---

## Future Enhancements

The order_addons table now enables:
1. **Addon Analytics**: Track popular add-ons by season/month
2. **Recommendation Engine**: ML models to suggest add-ons based on purchase history
3. **Addon Promotions**: Limited-time addon bundles or discounts
4. **Customer Insights**: Understand which customers prefer add-ons

---

## Files Modified

1. **frontend/src/pages/CartPage.jsx**
   - Line ~191-195: Added selected_addons to startRazorpay request

2. **backend/api/customer/razorpay-create-order.php**
   - Lines 167-180: Extract and calculate addon costs
   - Lines 207-219: Persist add-ons to database
   - Line 254: Include addon_total in response

## Files Referenced (No Changes)

- `frontend/src/components/customer/AddonSuggestions.jsx` (already correct)
- `backend/api/customer/checkout.php` (already has addon support)
- `backend/database/order_addons_migration.php` (table already created)

---

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Verify order_addons table exists
php C:\xampp\php\php.exe C:\xampp\htdocs\my_little_thingz\backend\database\order_addons_migration.php
# Output: ✓ Table 'order_addons' already exists.
```

---

## Known Limitations

- None currently. The implementation handles edge cases:
  - Empty addon list (no cost added)
  - Missing addon properties (safely skipped)
  - Missing database table (gracefully ignored)

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Add-ons still not showing in Razorpay payment  
**Solution**: 
1. Clear browser cache
2. Verify selectedAddons state contains addon objects
3. Check browser Network tab - confirm request body includes selected_addons
4. Check backend logs for any errors

**Issue**: Addon costs appearing twice  
**Solution**: Verify frontend summary calculation doesn't duplicate addon costs
