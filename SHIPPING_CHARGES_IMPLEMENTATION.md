# üö¢ Shipping Charges Implementation - Complete

## ‚úÖ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

The shipping charges feature has been successfully implemented in the checkout payment flow. Customers will now see shipping charges calculated based on product weight before completing payment.

---

## üìã Summary of Changes

### Problem
- Shipping charges were hardcoded as `$0.00` in the backend
- Frontend showed "Calculated at checkout" but never actually calculated shipping
- Payment was processed without including shipping costs
- The "Price summary" modal in Razorpay checkout showed only Subtotal = Grand Total (no shipping)

### Solution
1. ‚úÖ Added `weight` column to artworks table (default: 0.5 kg)
2. ‚úÖ Updated backend to calculate shipping based on total cart weight
3. ‚úÖ Modified API response to include shipping breakdown
4. ‚úÖ Updated frontend to display shipping charges before payment
5. ‚úÖ Ensured Razorpay receives the full amount including shipping

---

## üîß Technical Implementation

### 1. Database Schema Update

**File:** `backend/database/add_artwork_weight.php`

Added `weight` column to artworks table:
```sql
ALTER TABLE artworks 
ADD COLUMN weight DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0.50 
COMMENT 'Weight in kilograms for shipping calculation';

UPDATE artworks SET weight = 0.50 WHERE weight IS NULL OR weight = 0;
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ Migration executed successfully - all artworks now have weight field

---

### 2. Backend API Updates

**File:** `backend/api/customer/razorpay-create-order.php`

#### Changes Made:

**A. Updated Cart Query (Line 40)**
```php
// Added a.weight to fetch weight data for each cart item
SELECT c.id, c.artwork_id, c.quantity, a.title, a.price, a.image_url, a.weight,
       a.offer_price, a.offer_percent, a.offer_starts_at, a.offer_ends_at
FROM cart c
JOIN artworks a ON c.artwork_id = a.id
WHERE c.user_id = ?
```

**B. Calculate Total Weight (Lines 65-95)**
```php
// Compute effective prices (offer-aware) and total weight
$now = new DateTime('now');
$subtotal = 0.0;
$totalWeight = 0.0;

foreach ($cart as &$it) {
    // ... price calculation logic ...
    
    // Calculate total weight
    $itemWeight = isset($it['weight']) && $it['weight'] > 0 ? (float)$it['weight'] : 0.5;
    $totalWeight += $itemWeight * ((int)$it['quantity']);
}
```

**C. Calculate Shipping Charges (Lines 97-100)**
```php
// Calculate shipping charges: ‚Çπ60 per kg, minimum ‚Çπ60
$tax = 0.0;
$shipping = max(60.0, ceil($totalWeight) * 60.0); // Round up weight to nearest kg
$total = $subtotal + $tax + $shipping;
```

**D. Store Weight in Orders Table (Line 109)**
```php
$ins = $db->prepare("INSERT INTO orders (user_id, order_number, status, payment_method, 
    payment_status, total_amount, subtotal, tax_amount, shipping_cost, weight, 
    shipping_address, created_at) VALUES (?, ?, 'pending', 'razorpay', 'pending', 
    ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, NOW())");
$ins->execute([$user_id, $order_number, $total, $subtotal, $tax, $shipping, 
    $totalWeight, $shipping_address]);
```

**E. Updated API Response (Lines 138-152)**
```php
echo json_encode([
    'status' => 'success',
    'order' => [
        'id' => $order_id,
        'order_number' => $order_number,
        'razorpay_order_id' => $rp['id'],
        'amount' => $total,              // Includes shipping
        'currency' => $config['currency'],
        'subtotal' => $subtotal,         // NEW: Breakdown
        'tax' => $tax,                   // NEW: Breakdown
        'shipping' => $shipping,         // NEW: Breakdown
        'weight' => $totalWeight         // NEW: For reference
    ],
    'key_id' => $config['key_id']
]);
```

---

### 3. Frontend Updates

**File:** `frontend/src/pages/CartPage.jsx`

#### Changes Made:

**A. Added State for Shipping Charges (Line 34)**
```javascript
const [shippingCharges, setShippingCharges] = useState(0);
```

**B. Capture Shipping from API Response (Lines 175-178)**
```javascript
const { key_id, order } = data;

// Update shipping charges from backend response
if (order.shipping) {
  setShippingCharges(order.shipping);
}
```

**C. Updated Cart Summary UI (Lines 393-401)**
```javascript
<aside className="cart-summary">
  <div className="row">
    <span>Subtotal</span>
    <strong>‚Çπ{subtotal.toFixed(2)}</strong>
  </div>
  <div className="row">
    <span>Shipping</span>
    <strong>
      {shippingCharges > 0 ? `‚Çπ${shippingCharges.toFixed(2)}` : 'Calculated at checkout'}
    </strong>
  </div>
  {shippingCharges > 0 && (
    <div className="row" style={{ 
      borderTop: '2px solid #6b46c1', 
      paddingTop: '8px', 
      marginTop: '8px' 
    }}>
      <span style={{ fontWeight: 600 }}>Grand Total</span>
      <strong style={{ fontSize: '1.2em', color: '#6b46c1' }}>
        ‚Çπ{(subtotal + shippingCharges).toFixed(2)}
      </strong>
    </div>
  )}
</aside>
```

## üí∞ Shipping Calculation Formula

### Rate Structure
- **Base Rate:** ‚Çπ60 per kilogram
- **Minimum Charge:** ‚Çπ60 (even for items under 1 kg)
- **Weight Rounding:** Rounded UP to nearest kilogram

### Formula
```
shipping_charges = max(60, ceil(total_weight) * 60)
```

### Examples

| Cart Weight | Rounded Weight | Shipping Charges |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| 0.1 kg      | 1 kg           | ‚Çπ60              |
| 0.5 kg      | 1 kg           | ‚Çπ60              |
| 1.0 kg      | 1 kg           | ‚Çπ60              |
| 1.5 kg      | 2 kg           | ‚Çπ120             |
| 2.0 kg      | 2 kg           | ‚Çπ120             |
| 2.5 kg      | 3 kg           | ‚Çπ180             |
| 3.1 kg      | 4 kg           | ‚Çπ240             |

### Multi-Item Cart Example
```
Cart Items:
- Painting 1: 0.5 kg √ó 1 = 0.5 kg
- Sculpture 1: 2.0 kg √ó 1 = 2.0 kg
- Frame 1: 0.3 kg √ó 2 = 0.6 kg

Total Weight: 3.1 kg
Rounded Weight: 4 kg
Shipping Charges: ‚Çπ240
```

5. Razorpay modal shows: Amount = ‚Çπ400 (NO SHIPPING)
6. Payment processed for ‚Çπ400 only
```

### After Implementation
```

7. Razorpay modal shows: Amount = ‚Çπ460 (INCLUDES SHIPPING)
8. Payment processed for ‚Çπ460 (full amount)
9. Order stored with weight and shipping_cost in database
```

## üìû Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Shipping shows as "Calculated at checkout" even after clicking "Pay Securely"
- **Cause:** API response not received or shipping not in response
- **Solution:** Check browser console for API errors, verify backend is running

**Issue:** Razorpay modal shows wrong amount
- **Cause:** Frontend not using updated total with shipping
- **Solution:** Verify `order.amount` in API response includes shipping

**Issue:** Order in database has shipping_cost = 0
- **Cause:** Backend not calculating shipping or not storing it
- **Solution:** Check `razorpay-create-order.php` for calculation logic

**Issue:** All items showing 0.5 kg weight
- **Cause:** Default weight not updated for specific artworks
- **Solution:** Update individual artwork weights in admin panel

### Debug Steps
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Check Network tab for API request/response
3. Verify API response includes `order.shipping` field
4. Check database: `SELECT weight, shipping_cost FROM orders ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1;`
5. Test with `backend/test_shipping_calculation.php`
