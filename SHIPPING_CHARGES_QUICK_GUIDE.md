## What Changed?

### BEFORE ‚ùå
```
Price Summary:
‚îú‚îÄ Subtotal: ‚Çπ400
‚îî‚îÄ Grand Total: ‚Çπ400
   (No shipping charges!)
```

## How It Works

### 1. **Weight-Based Calculation**
Every artwork now has a weight (default: 0.5 kg)

### 2. **Shipping Rate**
- ‚Çπ60 per kilogram
- Minimum charge: ‚Çπ60

### 3. **Formula**
```
Shipping = max(‚Çπ60, ceil(total_weight) √ó ‚Çπ60)
```

### 4. **Examples**

| Cart Weight | Shipping Charge |
|-------------|-----------------|
| 0.5 kg      | ‚Çπ60             |
| 1.0 kg      | ‚Çπ60             |
| 1.5 kg      | ‚Çπ120            |
| 2.5 kg      | ‚Çπ180            |
| 3.1 kg      | ‚Çπ240            |
