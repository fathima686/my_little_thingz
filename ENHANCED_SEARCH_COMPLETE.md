- **"sweet"** ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è Found 0 results (no products with "sweet" in title/description)

### üîß **Why "sweet" search shows 0 results:**
The search system is working perfectly, but your database doesn't have products with "sweet" or "chocolate" in their titles/descriptions. Your existing products are:
- "nuts hamper" (in Gift box category)
- "birthday card" (in Wedding card category)  
- "wedding card" (in Wedding card category)
- "heart boquetes" (in boquetes category)

## üöÄ **To Make "Sweet" Search Work:**

### Option 1: Add Sample Products
Add products with "sweet" keywords:
```sql
INSERT INTO artworks (title, description, price, category_id) VALUES
('Sweet Chocolate Box', 'Delicious sweet chocolate assortment', 299.99, 5),
('Premium Sweet Treats', 'Premium collection of sweet treats', 499.99, 1),
('Sweet Nuts Hamper', 'Sweet and savory nuts hamper', 399.99, 1),
('Custom Sweet Chocolate', 'Personalized sweet chocolate', 199.99, 5);
```

### Option 2: Update Existing Products
Add "sweet" keywords to existing product descriptions:
```sql
UPDATE artworks SET description = CONCAT(description, ' - Sweet and delicious') 
WHERE title LIKE '%nuts%' OR title LIKE '%chocolate%';
```

## üéâ **The Enhanced Search System is Ready!**

### **How to Test:**
1. **Open your website**
2. **Look for the AI Enhanced Search button** (magic wand icon) next to the search box
3. **Click it** to open the enhanced search modal
4. **Try searching with:**
   - "birthday" ‚Üí Should show birthday cards and gifts
   - "heart" ‚Üí Should show heart bouquets and custom drawings
   - "card" ‚Üí Should show wedding cards and birthday cards
   - "gift" ‚Üí Should show gift boxes and hampers

### **Expected Results:**
